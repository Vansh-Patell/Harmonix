**What are we doing the same?**

- Splitting of tasks is done in the same way as we did in Iteration 1 where each group member picks up a user story to work on based on their strong points.
- The branching strategy that we used in Iteration 1 was to have a develop branch for each iteration and the features were branching off of it. We plan to use the same strategy in Iteration 2.
- Most of the meetings for project discussions would be done during class time or immediately after class since all the members are present.

**What are we doing differently**

- Each member is supposed to keep track of their user stories which includs changing the time estimates, updating the architecture diagram and comments on what they have completed so far, so other members can work based on that.
- We will create designs of what is expected in terms of UI for each feature so other members can maintain the same consistency throughout the app.
- Contact other members immediately for any coding/bug related help, since one late submission affects the progression of the entire project.
- Strictly follow due dates for user stories so we have plenty of time in the end to change anything if we had to.
