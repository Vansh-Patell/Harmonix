# Here's how we have improved this Iteration:

**Better Time Management:** We're getting more accurate with our time estimates, helping us stay on track with deadlines. Most of our issues are getting done within the estimated time.

Examples,

**Clear Documentation:** Keeping our user stories explicit with Dev tasks and architecture diagrams updated has made it easier for everyone to understand the project's status and requirements. Dev tasks are added as "Child Items" under user stories.

**Improved Collaboration:** We're reaching out to each other promptly for coding help, which prevents delays.
For instance, when I got stuck while implementing the search bar, I contacted one of the other members of the group and they immediately helped me to finish that issue and shared the code through onedrive with me.
