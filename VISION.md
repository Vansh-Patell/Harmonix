## Vision Statement

The Harmonix is a go-to music management app, that will be used to make a user's music experience effortless and enjoyable. It's a place to explore new genres, craft personalized playlists, and have your entire music library at your fingertips. Unlike other music apps, this app is created to be user-friendly and straightforward, ensuring that even individuals with limited tech expertise can easily navigate through it.

Harmonix is an innovative music management application that caters to any music enthusiasts that have different musical preferences and enjoy listening to music at any time and any place. Harmonix aims to help users engage with, and enjoy music to their own individual preference anyway they desire and be able to manage catalogs of created playlists efficiently, that supports organization based on albums,artists and more. Harmonix allows users to get recommendations based on their preferences and share their favorite songs and playlists with others, with an easy to navigate layout that will be accessible by anybody.

By allowing users to create personal accounts and libraries, Harmonix offers a tailored music experience. This personalization enhances user satisfaction and engagement. The app's feature to discover new music based on user preferences is particularly valuable for users looking to expand their musical horizons and find new artists or genres that align with their tastes. By integrating social media, Harmonix will also enhance the social experience of music listening.

The ability to download music for offline listening is a significant benefit for users who might have limited internet access or wish to conserve data usage. Features for sorting and selecting music in the library, along with playlist creation and management reduce the time and effort required to find or organize music.

The project will be considered a success based off a few criteria; Based off surveys & interviews between usage of common music library apps and our app, we will determine which app users prefer, with ours being chosen the most being the goal. Another part of our success criteria is that the minimum number of steps to accomplish any common action between the most popular music management apps and our app should be minimal or at the most should take 5 steps to accomplish, with the reasoning behind the goal being to make our app as simple as possible for users.
