            Our development path had its fair share of highs and lows. While,
            working together as a team was great and and each of us contributed
            something worthwhile, there were also instances when we struggled
            with time management, which led to some delays in releases. Inspite
            of these difficulties, we gained a lot of knowledge about
            problem-solving, time management, and cooperation while building
            software. <br /><br />
            <b>Positives: </b>
            <br />
            - Collaboration with team members <br />
            - Solving complex problems together <br />
            - Industry experience <br /><br />
            <b>Negatives: </b>
            <br />
            - Communication issues at the early stages of the project <br />
            - Quality inconsistencies in the codebase <br />
            - Dependency on other team members to complete tasks before moving
            on to the next

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            After iteration 2, we realized our tests needed work. We didn't have
            enough tests for certain parts of our app, so we focused on making
            them better. We spent time making sure our tests covered all the
            important parts of our app, even the tricky bits. Thus the system
            test suite was developed thoruoghly to compensate for the other
            iteration's testing.

            In one of our success criterias, we set a goal to make it easier to
            add new features. To do this, we improved how we tested our code. By
            making our code easier to test through refactoring, we succeeded in
            adding features like the queue and playlists more smoothly. This
            showed that our testing improvements helped us add new stuff faster,
            just like we wanted

      <div class="faq-item3">
        <button class="faq-question">
          Did any features work better than expected?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Some features worked even better than we thought they would. For
            example, the search tool was faster and more accurate than we
            expected. It quickly found what users were looking for, making the
            app easier to use. Also, creating playlists turned out to be simpler
            and more helpful than we thought. Users liked how easy it was to
            organize their music. These surprises made our project even better!

            Additionally, we would allocate more time for regular code reviews
            and feedback sessions to ensure better code quality throughout the
            development process. Also, prioritize documenting our code and
            project decisions to make it easier for other team members to get
            onboard. Finally, we would establish clearer guidelines for feature
            prioritization and task allocation to optimize our release planning
            and meet project deadlines more effectively by priotizing easier
            features first. These adjustments would change our overall
            development experience and project outcomes.
